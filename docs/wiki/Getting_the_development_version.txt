This page describes how to get the source code of FirstDrive. It assumes your computer meets the [[Requirements|requirements]]. 

__TOC__
FirstDrive's code is kept in a [http://git-scm.com/ Git] repository, hosted by [https://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift GitHub]. Some operating system's dependencies are also hosted on GitHub, and the data is hosted on [https://vdrift.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vdrift/vdrift-data Sourceforge] in a [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion] repository.

==Downloading a snapshot==
Both GitHub and Sourceforge allow you to download a snapshot of the current state of the repository.

===Source code===
The source code can be downloaded by going to the [https://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift/downloads downloads section] of GitHub and click either "Download as zip" or "Download as tar.gz". Once it has downloaded, uncompress the resulting file into a folder called '''vdrift'''.

===Dependencies===
Dependencies for Windows and OS X can be downloaded in the same way as the source code, from https://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift-win/downloads or https://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift-mac/downloads respectively. They should be uncompressed into '''vdrift/vdrift-win''' or '''vdrift/vdrift-mac'''.

===Data===
The data can be downloaded from http://vdrift.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vdrift/vdrift-data/ - just click "Download GNU tarball" near the bottom of the page. Uncompress to '''vdrift/data'''.

==Cloning/Checking out==
To easily stay up to date with the latest changes, and to avoid re-downloading large amounts of data, you can use [http://git-scm.com/ Git] and [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion] to clone/check out the repositories to your computer. For the following sections it is assumed you have installed [http://git-scm.com/ Git] and [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion], and have some knowledge of the command line. If you are using a Git or Subversion client, follow its instructions for downloading repositories.

===Source code===
The following command will clone the source code to a folder called '''vdrift''' in the current directory:
 git clone git://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift.git
Then navigate to the '''vdrift''' folder:
 cd vdrift

===Dependencies===
Cloning the dependencies for Windows and OS X is similar to cloning the source code. Make sure you are still in the '''vdrift''' folder, then execute the command for your operating system:
* Windows:
 git clone git://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift-win.git
* OS X:
 git clone git://github.com/FirstDrive/vdrift-mac.git

===Data===
The data can be checked out into the '''vdrift/data''' folder with the following command. Make sure you are still in the '''vdrift''' folder.
 svn co https://vdrift.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vdrift/vdrift-data data
This will take a while to complete as the data is quite big.
