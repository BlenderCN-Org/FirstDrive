FirstDrive aims to be very user input friendly, and thus there are many different ways to adjust the controls in the game to fit each user's needs. There are options which affect all the controls, options which affect only a certain type of controls, and options that affect each individual control assignment.

==Features==
* Any input method can be used to navigate the menu.
* Joysticks can be used by calibrating them in the Options -> Controls -> Joystick -> Calibrate menu.
* Any input can be assigned to any control.
* Gas, brake, and steering controls only allow a single setting. All other controls can have any number of settings on any types of input devices.

==Control options==
Control options are defined in the text configuration file [[options.config]], set in the Options -> Controls menu and its submenus, and stored in the text configuration file [[FirstDrive.config]].
===AutoClutch===
* type: boolean
* setting: control.autoclutch
* values: on, off
Enable/disable automatic clutching (prevents car from stalling). Simulates the driver pressing the clutch in using foot when RPM gets close to the stall point.

===AutoShift===
* type: boolean
* setting: control.autotrans
* values: on, off
Enable/disable automatic transmission shifting.

===Button Control Delay===
* type: float
* setting: control.button_ramp
* values: off (0.0), long (5.0), medium (7.5), short (10.0)
Slow down application of button inputs on analog controls.

===Speed Affect on Steering===
* type: float
* setting: control.speed_sens_steering
* values: range 0.0 to 1.0
The higher the value on this setting, the more steering is limited as car speed increases.

===Joystick Type===
* type: string
* setting: joystick.type
* values: "joystick", "wheel"
Change the type of joystick device.

===Force Feedback Device===
* type: string
* setting: joystick.ff_device
* values: something like "/dev/input/eventX"
Device file for force feedback events.  For more detail, see [[Setting up force feedback]].

===Force Feedback Gain===
* type: float
* setting: joystick.ff_gain
* values: range 0.5 to 5.0
Multiplier to adjust strength of force feedback.

===Invert Force===
* type: boolean
* setting: joystick.ff_invert
* values: on, off
Reverse the force feedback, if necessary for your wheel.

===200 Degree Wheel===
* type: boolean
* setting: joystick.two_hundred
* values: on, off
Limit steering range to 200 degrees, gives a realistic feel to limited range wheels.

==Assigning controls==
Control assignments can be configured through the submenus of the Options -> Controls -> Assign Controls menu, and stored in the text configuration file [[controls]]. Control assignments can be edited after they are set.

There are two basic types of control, analog and digital. Analog controls include joystick axes and mouse motion, while digital controls are keys, mouse buttons and joystick buttons. Any type of input can be assigned to any type of control.

So, for example, a digital control - like a key - can be assigned to an analog control. If the "Button Control Delay" option is something other than 0.0, then the key will behave just like a true analog control.

==Editing Controls==
After controls have been assigned they can be edited to change some properties of the control. To edit a control just click on it in one of the control assignment menus.
===Analog control properties===
Analog controls include joystick axes and mouse motion. These have options for deadzone, gain and exponent.

====Deadzone====
Deadzone allows motion under a certain threshold percentage to be ignored. This is useful if you use a joystick which "wobbles" around the center. You may see the brake lights come on when you let go of the gas, or the car is hard to keep going straight, deadzone will help to fix these things.

====Gain====
Gain multiplies the input value by a percentage. This will make the input value increase linearly.

====Exponent====
Exponent raises the input value on an exponential curve. This helps give more fine-tuning of controls such as steering around the center but still allows for making sharp turns if needed.

===Digital control properties===
====Up/Down====
This controls whether the action will be triggered when the button/key is pressed (down), or released (up).

====Held/Once====
This should be set to "held" when they a digital input is mapped to an analog control, like when using keys for gas, brake or steering. This is set automatically when the control is assigned.

==Deleting controls==
There is a Delete button on each Control Editing screen, so to delete a control just click on it, then click Delete.
