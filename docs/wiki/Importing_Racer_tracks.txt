==Directions for importing Racer tracks==
{{note|These instructions are meant for Linux}}

* Unzip and put racer files in temporary folder ''RACER_TP'' (temporary track path). Make sure the path has no spaces (dof2joe doesn't like spaces).
* Create new folder for track in track editor folder ''TRACKEDITOR_TP''.
* Convert all texture names to lowercase in ''RACER_TP'' via
 find . -type f -name \*.tga|sort -r|awk '{f=tolower($1);
 if(f!=$1 && p[f]!=1){print "mv "$1" "f}p[$1]=1}' | /bin/sh
* Make folder '''''TRACKEDITOR_TP''/objects/'''
* Run the following command:
 dof2joe/dof2joe -p TRACKEDITOR_TP/objects/ RACER_TP/*.dof
If there are thousands of .dof files, you may have to do this in steps to avoid a "too many arguments" error from your shell. This will take a while. Textures are automatically converted using nconvert. No filenames should have spaces.
* Open track editor '''data/tracks/editor.config''' and set active track to ''TRACKEDITOR_TP''.
* Run the track editor. Trace the roadways and mark the starting position (press H for help).
* cd to the '''''TRACKEDITOR_TP''/objects''' folder (this is important, the packfile stores relative paths) and run
 joepack/joepack -c objects.jpk *.joe
* Copy ''TRACKEDITOR_TP'' into the main FirstDrive tracks folder ''VDRIFT_TP''. Erase '''''VDRIFT_TP''/objects/*.joe''' (since they are in the pack file).
* Add '''''VDRIFT_TP''/about.txt''' and ensure that the first line is the name of the track.
* Run FirstDrive and check out what the track looks like in-game. Note that you will only be able to drive on the roadways you defined in the track editor since no other surfaces have been flagged as collideable. Also take a screenshot for the track selection screen.
* Add the track selection screenshot to '''''VDRIFT_TP''/trackshot.png''' (hopefully these png files will be moved into the folders of the individual tracks soon).
* Open up all of the texture files in '''''TRACKEDITOR_TP''/objects''' and review which textures belong to objects that should be collide-able (roads and walls), have full brightness (trees), be mipmapped (fences and fine transparent objects should not be mipmapped), or be skyboxes.
* Any textures that have transparent areas are usually colored #FF00FF in the Racer textures. You'll need to make these truly transparent in the PNG files. An easy way to do this is to use ImageMagick. Use the commands
 mogrify -transparent rgb\(255,0,255\) *.png
 mogrify -fill rgb\(128,128,128\) -opaque rgba\(255,0,255,0\) *.png
This can be scripted to speed things up of course.
* Set the correct object properties using the '''trackeditor/listedit''' [[Listedit tool]].
* Done!
