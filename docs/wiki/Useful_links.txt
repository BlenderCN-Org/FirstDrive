==Open Source Driving Simulators and Racing Games==
Some more driving simulators:
* [http://torcs.org/ The Open Race Car Simulator (TORCS)] - A car racing simulation focusing on AI racing and research. It can also be used as a ordinary car racing game too.
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/trigger-rally/ Trigger Rally] - A fast-paced open source rally racing game.
* [http://vamos.sourceforge.net/ Vamos Automotive Simulator] - A automotive simulation framework with an emphasis on thorough physical modeling and good C++ design. It includes a real-time, first-person, 3D driving application.
* [http://speed-dreams.sourceforge.net/ Speed Dreams] - A fork of the TORCS, aiming to implement exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents to make a more enjoyable game for the player, as well as constantly improving visual and physics realism.
* [http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/ Super TuxCart] - A free 3D kart racing game
* [http://code.google.com/p/vdrift-ogre/ Stunt Rally] - A racing game that focuses on closed rally tracks with possible stunt elements (jumps, loops, pipes). It uses FirstDrive for car simulation.
