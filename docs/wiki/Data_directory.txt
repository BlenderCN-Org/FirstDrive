FirstDrive must be able to access its game data to run. This data is stored in the data directory.

==Location==
FirstDrive looks in several places to find its game data at startup. This is the order in which the different locations are checked.
# The directory specified in the environment variable '''VDRIFT_DATA_DIRECTORY'''
# The subdirectory "data" of the current working directory (the location from which FirstDrive was run)
# A directory named at [[Compiling|compile]]-time via the environment variable '''DATA_DIR''' (usually set by the [[Using SCons|SCons]] build setup)
{{note|On Windows, only locations 1 and 2 are checked.}}

==Validation==
To ensure that it has the correct location, FirstDrive checks for the file '''data/settings/[[options.config]]'''. If this file can't be found in any of the above locations, FirstDrive exits immediately.
