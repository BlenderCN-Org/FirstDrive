'''FirstDrive.config''' is the main user settings file for FirstDrive. It is in the [[configfile format]]. It is not the only file which FirstDrive uses for storing user settings (see also [[configuring the controls]]); however, it is the one which contains most of the settings important to users. FirstDrive does not use any kind of registry or configuration database. The options available to this configuration file are the ones defined in [[options.config]].

==Location and Defaults==
'''FirstDrive.config''' is located inside the [[user settings directory]]. The default '''FirstDrive.config''' is located in '''data/settings/FirstDrive.config'''. If FirstDrive fails to start, the next time it runs, it will move the user's current '''FirstDrive.config''' to '''FirstDrive.config.backup''' and make a new '''FirstDrive.config''' from the default one.
