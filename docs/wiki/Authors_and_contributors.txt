==Authors==
FirstDrive was created by [http://vdrift.net/Forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=1 Joe Venzon] who continues to fix bugs in the game,  as well as writing new subsystems and maintaining old ones. Joe created everything in FirstDrive which is not attributed to someone else below.

The physics engine in the game was originally [http://vamos.sourceforge.net/ Vamos Automotive Simulator], written by Sam Varner. As time went on it underwent many modifications. Now, the physics system has been rewritten.

==Current Contributors==
===Code===
* [http://vdrift.net/Forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=4879 NaN] has rewritten the physics code, added car color selection, implemented multi-language menus, and continues to fix bugs and add new features.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=4 Chris Guirl] set up the web sites and the Subversion repositories, and is also to blame for the SCons build scripts, XS model, some miscellaneous graphics, much of the GUI system, bug fixes and reports, documentation, testing, support, and generally annoying Joe. Chris is currently working on a driver training system with evaluation of driving behavior and driver feedback.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=1435 Francis Whittle] has improved the car suspension by adding new types of suspension.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=5534 Antonio Caiazzo] is working on a new AI system based on neural networks.

===Game Data===
Most of the imported cars and tracks had several authors to begin with, too many to list here. Thanks to them anyway, and in general to [http://www.racer-xtreme.com/ Racer-Xtreme] and the [http://www.racer.nl/ Racer community] at [http://www.rscnet.org/ Race Sim Central].

* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=412 alex25] has imported most of the tracks from various sources, and helped maintain them over time.

====Cars====
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=1337 Ny Dedes] TC6, LE, and is working on a new car, the ATT.  also modeled the driver, and coded the mesh generation for tires and brake rotors.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=3407 Timothy Porter] is working on preparing freely-licensed car models for import, and polishing the track Rouen.

===Ports===

==Former Contributors==
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=240 Dick Maurer] imported many cars from Racer and other sources, and created several too.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=755 rookie1] wrote the automatic shifting code, and the entire artificial intelligence system. He's also fixed a few bugs here and there, and made some improvements to the track editor.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=5095 MirceaKitsune] contributed new skins for several cars, and several patches including adding reverse lights, sounds for gear, brake and handbrake, and a new car coloring implementation with adapted skins.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=710 cotharyus] improved the car specifications for many models using research done on the internet, as well as play testing.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=197 Matthew Nicholson] helped with testing and debugging, worked on Debian GNU/Linux packaging, and improved the build system.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=364 Szymon Ender] packaged FirstDrive for Slackware Linux and helped get FirstDrive into Arch Linux.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=1356 Goneri Le Bouder] worked on Debian GNU/Linux packaging and helped get FirstDrive into Arch Linux.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=32 Nathan Samson] managed the FirstDrive port for Windows (Cygwin) and helped set up the Autopackage builder for Linux. He also added the first version of internationalization support.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=158 Alex (Nenillo)] took care of the Windows port for a while before Nathan.
* [http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=769 pwp71] helped maintain track data when new features became available.
