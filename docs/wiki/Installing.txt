This page describes how to install the latest FirstDrive package. It assumes you have [[Downloading|downloaded the latest release]].

==Windows==
* Double click the '''vdrift-''yyyy-mm-dd''.exe''' file (probably in your '''Downloads''' folder).
* Follow the instructions in the wizard that opens.
* Start FirstDrive from the Start menu (if you have chosen to install the shortcuts).

==OS X==
* If your browser hasn't automatically opened it, double click the '''vdrift-mac-''yyyy-mm-dd''.dmg''' file (probably in your '''Downloads''' folder).
* Drag or copy the '''FirstDrive''' application from the resulting mounted disk image named '''FirstDrive''' to your '''Applications''' folder.
* Double-click the '''FirstDrive''' application now found in your '''Applications''' folder.

==Linux==
FirstDrive hasn't been released with a standalone binary package for several releases. If you think you could help us with this, please post in the forums!

==FreeBSD==
To install the binary package, just use '''pkg_add''':
 pkg_add -r vdrift
{{note|If you choose install vdrift from packages, you must install vdrift-data from FreeBSD ports tree, because this is not available as package.}}
 cd /usr/ports/games/vdrift-data && make install clean clean-depends
