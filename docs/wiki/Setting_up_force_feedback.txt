Force feedback is currently only supported on Linux.

==Prerequisites==
* a steering wheel supporting constant force effects (like a Logitech Momo Racing force feedback steering wheel)
* Linux
* HID_FF is enabled in your kernel
* your device's USB ID is in '''kernel-source/drivers/usb/input/hid-ff.c'''
* the ff-utils test program ffcfstress works for you. Note the device name you use with this program (should be '''/dev/input/eventX''').
* write permission to '''/dev/input/eventX'''
* FirstDrive SVN r1547 or later

If you need to recompile your kernel to enable force feedback, you can have a look here [[Enabling force feedback in kernel]]

==Enabling force feedback in FirstDrive==
Once you've met the prerequisites, recompile vdrift like this:
 scons force_feedback=1

Now open your [[FirstDrive.config]]. Find the section <code>[ joystick ]</code> and add the following line to the joystick section somewhere:
 ff_device = /dev/input/event0
Change event0 to whatever device you should use (the one that worked with ffcfstress).

Start up FirstDrive. The console will print whether or not force feedback initialization succeeded.  Start a practice game. You should feel a force effect on your steering wheel based on the aligning moment force from the front tires.
