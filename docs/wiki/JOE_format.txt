This format is based on the md2 format but with a few enhanced features.  It can be written to using a python export script for the Blender 3D modeling package.

==Technical specification==
"JOE" is a binary file format in which multi-byte values are expressed with the little-endian byte order. This section details version 3 of the file format.

{{note|This documentation was generated by reverse engineering model.h and modle.cpp and inspecting the python blender export script.  So there may be errors in evaluation.}}

=== Data Type Map ===
The following table explicitly defines the various data types used in a JOE file.
{| border="1"
!Identifier!!Detailed Description
|-
|int||32-bit signed integer
|-
|short||16-bit signed integer 
|-
|short3||Three consecutive shorts forming an array
|-
|float||32-bit floating-point value.
Unsure of the exact format... probably whatever is implemented by x86 machines.
|-
|float3||Three consecutive floats forming an array.
|}

=== File Header ===
This block of information initiates every file.

{| border="1"
!data type!!block offset!!name!!description
|-
|int||0||magic
|'''8441211611'''(0x1F722AADB): number used to identify the file as a JOE file. Currently unchecked by vdrift.
|-
|int||4||version
|report the file version that this file conforms to.  This specification details version 3 of the format.
|-
|int||8||num_faces
|every frame is expected to contain the same number of faces (polygons) this value specifies how many.  This is currently limited to 32000.
|-
|int||12||num_frames
|Presumably, this details the number of frames used in an animation. Currently constrained to "1"
|}

=== Frame Format ===
details a single configuration of a model.  "File Header.num_frames" frames follow the file header.

{| border="1"
!data type!!block offset!!name!!description
|-
|int||0||num_verts
|the number of vertices used in this frame
|-
|int||4||num_textcoords
|the number of texture coordinates used in this frame.
|-
|int||8||num_normals
|the number of vertex normals used in this frame.
|}

after each frame header, you will find
* File Header.num_faces Face blocks
* num_verts Vertex blocks
* num_normals Vertex blocks
* num_textcoords Texture Coordinate blocks

===Face Format===
Each frame as "File Header.num_faces" face records immediately following  the Frame header (decribed above). A face is basically several lists of indices in to vertex, normal, and text coord arrays described in following sections.

For this version, a face is always a triangle ( i.e. a three-vertex polygon ).

{| border="1"
!data type!!block offset!!name!!description
|-
|short3||0||vertexIndex
|Indeces in to the vertex array.  These two constructs together define the location of each corner of the face in 3d space.
|-
|short3||6||normalIndex
|Indeces in to the normals array.  These two constructs help define how light sources interact with the face at each corner.  Normals also help define which side of a face is "front".
|-
|short3||12||textureIndex
|Indeces in to the texture coordinate array.  These two constructs together help define which portions of a texture image map to each corner of the face.  Note that in the future there may be a multiple of 3 entries in this array to accomidate applying many textures to a single face. Which images are used as textures by a particular model are defined by convention and explained in [[Car files and formats]] and [[Track files and formats]]
|}

===Vertex Format===
A vertex block simply contains a three-element float array.  Vertex blocks may have a misleading name because they are used for both vertices and normals.

{| border="1"
!data type!!block offset!!name!!description
|-
|float3||0||vertex||A three-element float array defining the X, Y, and Z components of  a vertex at offsets 0, 4, and 8 respectively
|}

===Texture Coordinate Format===
A texture coordinate is a 2-dimensional coordinate used to map prtions of a texture to a model vertex.
{| border="1"
!data type!!block offset!!name!!description
|-
|float||0||u||a value between 0 and 1 indicating a position along the width of the texture
|-
|float||4||v||a value between 0 and 1 indicating a position along the height of the texture.
|}
